ESP32 Duino-Coin Miner with OLED Display
Welcome to the ESP32 Duino-Coin Miner with OLED Display project! This repository contains all the necessary code and documentation to create a real-time mining statistics monitor using an ESP32 and a 0.96" OLED display. This project is perfect for cryptocurrency enthusiasts who want to track their miner's performance directly from the device.

Features
Real-time Mining Statistics: Displays current hashrate, shares, and temperature directly on the OLED.
Duino-Coin Integration: Optimized for mining Duino-Coin, showcasing how microcontrollers can be used in cryptocurrency mining.
Easy-to-Read Display: Uses a 0.96" OLED display for clear, crisp text and graphics.
Customizable Display Output: Code can be easily modified to display different stats or information as desired.
Prerequisites
Before you get started with this project, you will need:

An ESP32 development board
A 0.96" SSD1306 OLED display
Jumper wires for connections
Arduino IDE installed on your computer
Hardware Setup
OLED Display Connections:
Connect VCC to ESP32 3.3V
Connect GND to ESP32 GND
Connect SCL to ESP32 GPIO 22
Connect SDA to ESP32 GPIO 21
Software Setup
Install Required Libraries:

Open Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Librariesâ€¦
Install Adafruit SSD1306 and Adafruit GFX libraries.
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-duino-coin-oled.git
Prepare the Arduino Sketch:

Open the downloaded sketch in Arduino IDE.
Make sure to configure the Wi-Fi settings and Duino-Coin credentials in the sketch.
Upload the Code:

Connect the ESP32 to your computer via the USB cable.
Select the correct board under Tools > Board and the correct port under Tools > Port.
Upload the sketch to the ESP32.
Usage
Once the code is uploaded and the hardware is set up:

The ESP32 will connect to the Duino-Coin network and start mining.
The OLED display will show real-time statistics about the mining process.
You can monitor performance directly from the ESP32 without needing any external monitors.
